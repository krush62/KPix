# kpix

A pixel art creation tool.

## Overview

I started this project for fun to have a pixel art editor with features that support my usual workflow. Since I prefer drawing with a pen (on Android) but like the features of Aseprite on PC, I wanted to have something I could use on both platforms. The main differences/limitations compared to other existing tools are the following:
- exclusive use of indexed colors
- generative color ramps
- hsv based color representation
- shading capabilities for all tools
- cross-platform support 
- pen support
